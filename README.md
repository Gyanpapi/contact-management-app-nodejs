Its a Nodejs project.
While doing the project I faced two simple errors.

1) while working with nodemon , thunder wasn't working 
   ( with this cmd it didn't work command: npm run dev)
   ( but if i give "node --watch server.js" then "npm run dev" then it worked )

2) while making password ,in mongoDB , I used '@' at the end of my password , that also made an error ,couldn't connect with the Database
